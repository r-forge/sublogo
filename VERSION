by Toby Dylan Hocking

2.0

Use bioconductor package seqLogo instead of grImport/weblogo.

Find/write a grid method for drawing dendrograms.

More parameter options for the web form.

SeqinR for sequence IO.

1.2 16 april 2010

Port to windows using perl command line and R regular expressions
instead of shell commands in make.logo.ps.

1.1 april 2010

Update email.

1.0 13 oct 2009 r29

Uses grImport to import sequence logos from the weblogo program.

Uses gridBase to use grid graphics at the same time as base R
graphics, since there is no routine for drawing dendrograms in grid
graphics.
